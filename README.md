# 🏛️ Project Sovereign: The Enterprise AI Boardroom
We turned weeks of meetings into minutes of autonomous execution. This is Project Sovereign. Thank you.
### *Autonomous Supply Chain Orchestration Platform*

🏆 **Built for the IBM watsonx Challenge**
**Powered by IBM Granite-4-h-small & Watsonx.ai**

---

## 📖 The Problem
Modern supply chains are paralyzed by human latency. Approving a vendor change or writing an automation script requires coordination between **Finance**, **Engineering**, and **Operations**. This process usually takes days.

## 💡 The Solution
**Project Sovereign** is an autonomous "AI Executive Platform" that replaces slow meetings with **Agentic Workflows**. 

It does not just "chat." It **Reads** documents, **Debates** risk, **Decides** on strategy, and **Builds** the actual code implementation automatically.

## 🌟 Key Features (The "Sovereign" Engine)

### 1. 📂 Intelligent Document Analysis (RAG)
* **Input:** Upload real Vendor Proposals (PDFs) or type raw text.
* **Action:** The system reads the file, extracting hidden costs, timelines, and technical risks that humans might miss.

### 2. ⚔️ The Multi-Agent Boardroom
Three distinct AI Agents (running on **IBM Granite**) debate the proposal in real-time:
* **👨‍💻 Chief Architect:** Audits technical debt and security risks.
* **💰 CFO (Finance):** Enforces budget constraints and calculates ROI.
* **🚚 COO (Operations):** Prioritizes speed and logistics efficiency.

### 3. 🛠️ The Forge (Autonomous Code Gen)
* If a proposal is **APPROVED**, the system activates the **Engineer Agent**.
* It automatically writes **production-ready Python scripts** to implement the solution immediately.

### 4. 📊 The Watchtower (Analytics)
* Real-time dashboard visualizing **Risk Scores**, **Budget Impact**, and **Compliance Confidence**.
